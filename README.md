# Technical Debt: Epsilon Feature

This project aims to address this need by comparing and evaluating the performance of existing feature selection methods
in detecting epsilon features in datasets. By using real-world datasets (UCI) with known epsilon features (detect by feature importance) and
appropriate evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, Accuracy & Execution Time), the project will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each selected method of feature selection ((Mutual Information, Recursive Feature Elimination, Correlation-Based) and
identify the most effective one(s) for detecting epsilon features.

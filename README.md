# TechnicalDebt_EpsilonFeature

This project aims to address this need by comparing and evaluating the performance of existing feature selection methods
in detecting epsilon features in datasets. By using simulated and/or real-world datasets with known epsilon features and
appropriate evaluation metrics, the project will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method and
identify the most effective one(s) for detecting epsilon features. To reach this goal, the main activities of this
research projects are: -Collection of a catalog of existing Feature Selection Techniques. -Collection and Analysis of
Machine Learning Project/Projects suitable for the evaluation (e.g, projects that epsilon features) -Evaluation of
performance of feature selection techniques
